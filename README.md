# QueensNWNLootGenerator
A magic items generator created for Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition

This project was created as a part of Spellplague: The Rebirth, a NWN server that was based on Knights of Noromath. Spellplague shut down in 2023, shortly after this system was finished. It uses NBDE (https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/script/nbde-natural-bioware-database-extension-v10) as a dependency.
